With hands-on experience in full-stack development, digital marketing, and product design, I bring a holistic approach to solving business problems through technology.\n \n Today, I focus on applying that technical knowledge to leadership teams, helping organizations build smarter systems, more scalable products, and stronger customer experiences. Whether you're building a new platform, optimizing digital workflows, or aligning tech decisions with business outcomes I bring the technical fluency and strategic thinking to move ideas from concept to reality."
